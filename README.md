# Expert-Recommendation-System
Expert Systems are used in various places such as (i) finding suitable candidates for a job, (ii) finding experts to evaluate a 
project or grant proposal, (iii) finding suitable law-yers given a case description, (iv) finding suitable experts to answer 
questions in technical forums, tourism sites etc. This is short list of a much bigger application area with huge possibility of 
publication at some international conference. This is a very recent problem with increasing interest.

Description of the project. 

The basic task is to match each candidate with experts, where an expert can be matched with many candidates and a candidate can be 
matched with many experts (with partial ordering). 
There will be some documents correspoinding to each expert. Remember that, a person can be expert in multiple fields. 
The final task will be to match between experts and papers. A paper can be written on some research topics, and an expert is a 
person who has published papers on the same research topic in past. Given a paper you will have to short list a set of reviewers 
(10) with relevance score. 

Input Format:

The code takes three inputs: (i) path to a directory containing files for experts (one file for one expert, and one line for one 
document of the expert). (ii) Path to a directory containing documents for the candidates. (iii) Path to a directory for output.
